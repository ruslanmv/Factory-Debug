![alt text](./assets/logo-small.jpg)

**Factory Debug** is a groundbreaking program designed to revolutionize debugging and code fixing using state-of-the-art AI technologies. By providing a program as input, Factory Debug AI identifies bugs, analyzes the code, and attempts to auto-fix issues autonomously. This innovative approach aims to save developers significant time and effort, enabling faster resolution of coding problems.

This project extends the power of AI into the debugging process, offering a smart, automated solution while still leaving room for human oversight and intervention when necessary.
